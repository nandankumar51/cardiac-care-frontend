Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a leading cause of death worldwide, demanding early diagnosis, continuous monitoring, and timely medical intervention. However, many healthcare facilities still follow traditional appointment booking systems that fail to prioritize patients with urgent symptoms. The CardioCare System is a smart web-based platform designed to address this issue by enabling intelligent, symptom-based appointment booking for cardiology care. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze patient symptoms and assign a priority level, ensuring that high-risk individuals receive faster medical attention. This project combines technology with healthcare to deliver a patient-centric, efficient, and scalable solution to hospitals and clinics.
